For our group project, we have chosen to create an application that pairs up
children who share the same hobbies and interests. The main idea is to create
a platform which keeps track of all meetings that
are taking place, so if someone wants to join, he/she can simply send a
message to the other children who are already playing or their parents.
\newline
Then, since we have noticed that many children have made requests for a
platform on which they do not have to provide too much personal information
about themselves to join in, we have taught of a profile in which only basic
information is required. Once logged in, they are divided into similar age
groups and they can look for someone who has the same interests in an
intuitive way. To solve the problem of how to make it secure and to
be sure that nobody uses this platform except of the children, we thought
of using an authentication procedure done by the school.
