For our group project, we have chosen to create an application that pairs up children who share the same
hobbies and interests. The main idea is to create a platform which keeps track of all meetings that are
taking place, so if someone wants to join, he/she can simply send a message to the other children who are
already playing or their parents. Then, since we have noticed that many children have made requests for a
plat- form on which they do not have to provide too much personal information about themselves to join in,
we have taught of a profile in which only basic information is required. Once logged in, they are divided
into similar age groups and they can look for someone who has the same interests in an intuitive way. To
solve the problem of how to make it secure and to be sure that nobody uses this plat- form except of the
children, we thought of using an authentication procedure done by the school. \\
